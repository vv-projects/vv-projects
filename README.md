`Go Developer`  `Try something new` `Chose path of Clean Code`

I'm Go Developer, who tries to write code following the principles of Clean Code with the least amount of bugs.\
My projects were written from scratch, so they went from vague outlines to something worthy (at my opinion of course).\
I use Go only for 3 years: 2 years as a part of tech-team and 1 year just for the satisfaction of the soul. Also I get experience of C# for 1 year as a commercial experience and 1 year as self-study experience.<br>
I know how to save and get data from PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, MS SQL, ClickHouse.\
I also start learning React, just to make some presentable view for my projects. Of course, the backend is totally awesome, but with UI applications start to play with completely new, interesting colors.\
So, I`m on my way for full-stack development of something mind-blowing, I hope)
